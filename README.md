In the zip file I've submitted two files. In the first one "Classifier.py" there is the classifier coded following the graphs feature approach for preprocessing.
In the second one "Classifier2.py", with which I obtained best results the classifier has been coded preprocessing the dataset using the vectorizer. 
I did the blind test using this second classifier.
